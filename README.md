# React Starterkit

Comes with React and Webpack!

To start the server:
```
npm run serve
```

To have webpack watch:
```
npm run watch
```

This template is ready to be forked and quickly turned into something!

The Webpack config is based on the [Survive JS Webpack Guide](http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/)

Next is to implement hot reloading
